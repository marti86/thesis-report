\section{Conclusion}
This section has analysed various topics of interest starting with the data provided by Kamstrup. The provided data allows a simulation to be performed on data from a real network, so results can show how the approaches can perform in the real world. It has also been explained why a simulation is performed. This is due to simulations offering a way to perform a performance analysis with small execution times that allow for big networks. The set of two types of performance metrics are presented. Those used for comparison of Kamstrup's sequential data collection and the designed routing scheme and those used to describe the behaviour of the two approaches. Lastly reliable communication is analysed to give a picture of what aspects are necessary to consider for reliable communication and if multiple transmissions occurs. With the goal of acquiring realistic delays when performing multiple transmissions. The method of collision avoidance was chosen to be a functionality of the nodes with routing capabilities, whereas the simple retransmission method would be applied on the simple meters.
