\section{Software-Defined Networking}
\label{sec:sdn}

As it is explained in section \ref{sec:motivation}, the main problem of the current networks is that the control plane has no abstractions. That means that there is no modularity, which leads to limited functionality, since protocols with different proposals (such as routing, isolation or traffic engineering) coexist in the same layer.\\

One of the tendencies that seems to have more power for the next generation networking is Software-Defined Networking (SDN). One of the reasons to believe that SDN will be \emph{the one} is that some big companies, such as Google, are already using it.\cite{GoogleB4}\cite{GoogleWP}.\\

SDN is a new network architecture that allows be programmed as if it were a computer. It provides an abstraction of the forwarding function decoupling the data plane from control plane, which gives freedom to manage different topologies, protocols without many restrictions from the physical layer.\\

 SDN was designed to change that paradigm, dividing the control plane in three main layers: the forwarding model, the Network Operating System (NOS) and the control program.\\

\begin{description}
\item[Forwarding model:] composed by the Network Elements (i.e. switches) and a dedicated communicated channel from each NE with the NOS which uses a standard way of defining the forwarding state.  
\item[Network Operation System:] piece of software running in servers (controllers) which provides information about the current state of the network such as the topology or the state of each port. 
\item[Control program:] express the operator goals, and compute the forwarding state of each NE to accomplish those goals.
\end{description}

\subsection{Advantages}

SDN tries to improve the current networks. Bellow there is a list of the main advantages of the SDN paradigm.\\

\begin{description}
\item[OPEX reduction:] centralised control helps to eliminate manual interaction with the hardware, improving the uptime of the network. 
\item[CAPEX reduction:] separating the data plane of the control plane brings to a more simple hardware and increases the possibility of more competence between hardware manufacturers, since the devices don't depends on the proprietary software.
\item[Agility:] since the control layer can interact constantly with the infrastructure layer, the behaviour of the network can adapt fast to changes like failures or new traffic patterns. 
\item[Flexibility:] having a separated abstraction for the control program allows to express different operator goals, adapting to a specific objectives. Operators can implement features in software they control, rather than having to wait for a vendor to add it in their proprietary products.\\
