This is a report of a student project conducted on the $4^{\text{th}}$ semester of Networks and Distributed Systems, at Aalborg University. This project serves as a Master Thesis as the requirements of the master's programme dictate. This is applied in the comparison of a designed application used for Cognitive Networks concepts over a Software-Defined Network (SDN).\\

In this project Floodlight is used as an SDN controller, and the network is simulated using mininet software.
