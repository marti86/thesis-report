Nowadays networks use different kind of mechanisms in order to give priority to a certain sort of traffic to process the packets in a different way depending on their application. The most common way to achieve this is using Differentiated Service, marking the packets depending on their application (giving higher preference to those that are more important or time sensitive such as Voice over IP, or Video on Demand). However, determining resource allocation per class of service must be done with knowledge about traffic demands for the various traffic classes, keeping a fixed amount of bandwidth for each class, which results in a poor utilization of resources.\\

In the last years, a new networking approach called Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is emerging fast. This approach is based on the separation of data and control planes. Such approach allows the network administrator to have a more dynamic control of the network behaviour.
The purpose of this project is to analyse the possibilities that SDN provides to develop a more efficient resources allocation along the network.
