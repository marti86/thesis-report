\chapter{Pre-analysis}
\label{sec:preanalysis}

\textit{In order to investigate how to answer the initial problem stated in section \ref{sec:problemformulation}, some background information is needed. By analysing different topics related to the greater field of Context-Aware Networks and Service Migration, the main trends and leading approaches are identified and work as a guide to achieve the objectives of this project. In short, by performing the pre-analysis, knowledge on how to answer the initial problem is acquired.}

\section{Conclusion}
By performing the pre-analysis a more precise definition of the focus of the project is achieved. The constraints describe specifications that will be taken into account during the design of the network architecture. Through these an application and an approximate network architecture can be designed. The choices that are presented in the Network Architecture section \ref{sec:net_arch} provide inspiration for the design of the end system.
