\chapter{Algorithm Description}
\label{ch:algorithm}

\textit{ {\color{red} In this section I'll describe the algorithm. First a general overview, with a pseudo-code and a flow chart of its behaviour, and then a more deep explanation about each of the processes, such as how it detects new flows, how find all the routes,  how makes the rerouting decision, etc. } }
