\chapter{Emulation and Evaluation}
\label{ch:emulation}

\textit{ {\color{red}Here I'll explain the emulations done. I'm using MGEN to generate traffic, which allows to generate different patterns (burst, Poisson, ON-OFF) with UDP and TCP, and other parameters. It also introduce a timestamps in the packets. With the results of those traffics I can measure delay, bandwidth, and packet losses end-to-end.\\
The emulation will consist of generating different traffic patterns.\\ 
The evaluation wi evaluate end-to-end performance (delay, bandwidth, and packet losses), plus the network resources utilisation (links).}}
